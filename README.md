## How I Configured GitHub MCP Server in VS Code

1. **Installed the GitHub MCP Server Extension**
   - Searched for and installed the GitHub MCP Server extension in VS Code.

2. **Authenticated with GitHub**
   - Connected my GitHub account to VS Code using the extension's authentication flow.

3. **Used MCP Server Features**
   - Accessed MCP commands directly from the VS Code command palette.
   - Created this repository (`GithubMcpDemo`) using the MCP server integration, without leaving VS Code.

4. **Automated Repository Creation**
   - Triggered repository creation and file management (like adding this README) through MCP-powered commands and workflows.

This workflow streamlines GitHub operations directly from VS Code, making repository management fast and efficient.
